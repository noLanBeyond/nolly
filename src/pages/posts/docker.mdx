# Docker

[MORE HERE](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-containers/)

[SIMPLE EXAMPLES](https://github.com/btholt/projects-for-complete-intro-to-containers)

### Lifecycle

- `[docker create](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create>)` creates a container but does not start it.
- `[docker rename](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/>)` allows the container to be renamed.
- `[docker run](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run>)` creates and starts a container in one operation.
- `[docker rm](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm>)` deletes a container.
- `[docker update](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/>)` updates a container's resource limits.

**Notes:**

Start container and keep it running

- pass `-t` flag to allocate a pseudo-TTY session
- pass `-td` to detach automatically (run in background and print container ID)

Transient Container (ie. short-lived)

- run `docker run --rm` to remove container after it stops

Logging Driver (To run docker with a custom log driver [i.e., to syslog])

- `docker run --log-driver=syslog`

**Useful! allows you to start and stop a container by calling it by its name**

- `docker run --name yourname docker_image`

---

### **Starting and Stopping**

- `[docker start](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start>)` starts a container so it is running.
- `[docker stop](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop>)` stops a running container.
- `[docker restart](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart>)` stops and starts a container.
- `[docker pause](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/>)` pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
- `[docker unpause](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/unpause/>)` will unpause a running container.
- `[docker wait](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/wait>)` blocks until running container stops.
- `[docker kill](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill>)` sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
- `[docker attach](<https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach>)` will connect to a running container.

**Notes:**

If you want to detach from a running container

- `Ctrl + p, Ctrl + q`

# BUILD:

> Build an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag the image

```bash
docker build -t myimage:1.0 .
```

> List all images that are locally stored with the Docker Engine

```bash
docker image ls
```

> Delete an image from the local image store

```bash
docker image rm alpine:3.4
```

---

# RUN:

> Run a container from the Alpine version 3.9 image, name the running container “web” and expose port 5000 externally, mapped to port 80 inside the container.

```bash
docker container run --name web -p
5000:80 alpine:3.9
```

> List the running containers (add --all to include stopped containers)

```bash
docker container ls
```

> Delete all running and stopped containers

```bash
docker container rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```

> Print the last 100 lines of a container’s logs

```bash
docker container
logs --tail 100 web
```

> Stop a running container through SIGTERM

```bash
docker container stop web
```

> Stop a running container through SIGKILL

```bash
docker container kill web
```

> List the networks

```bash
docker network ls
```

---

# SHARE:

> Pull an image from a registry

```bash
docker pull myimage:1.0
```

> Retag a local image with a new image name and tag

```bash
docker tag myimage:1.0 myrepo/
myimage:2.0
```

> Push an image to a registry

```bash
docker push myrepo/myimage:2.0
```
